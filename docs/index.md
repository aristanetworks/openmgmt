## Welcome

This site is a collection of notes, examples, and documentation regarding the use of various network management protocols
with Arista EOS devices.  This is not a replacement for the official [Arista EOS
documentation](https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/) but should be considered something of a
cookbook for getting started with the management technologies available in EOS.

The source for this site is on [github](http://github.com/aristanetworks/openmgmt/). If you see something amiss or
you're interested in a particular topic that isn't being covered, please feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/aristanetworks/openmgmt/issues) or submit a [pull
request](https://github.com/aristanetworks/openmgmt/pulls).

N.B.: This is a continuous work in progress.
