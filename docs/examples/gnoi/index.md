## About gNOI

gNOI - gRPC Network Operations Interface

gNOI defines a set of gRPC-based microservices for executing operational commands on network devices.

gNOI [github repository](https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi)

As example, [this gNOI proto file](https://github.com/openconfig/gnoi/blob/master/system/system.proto) defines the
service `System` with the RPC `Traceroute` and `Ping`

- Ping executes the ping command on the target and streams back the results
- Traceroute executes the traceroute command on the target and streams back the results
- As you can see in the proto file, the field VRF is not defined for these messages
